# README Generator

![Badge for license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GNU_AGPLv3-blue)

## Description
It is a Node.js project that uses Inquire and Javascript to create aesthetically pleasing README.md's. It also allows for the developer to save time by simply filling out a questionaire vs hand typing a README.md for every project. It was a fun challenge and I look forward to adding more to it in the future.
